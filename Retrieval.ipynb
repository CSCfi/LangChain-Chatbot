I \\nwon't write on the chalkboard — http:// cs229.stanford.edu. And so when there are \\nhomework assignments or things like that, we usually won't sort of — in the mission of \\nsaving trees, we will usually not give out many handouts in class. So homework \\nassignments, homework solutions will be posted online at the course home page.  \\nAs far as this class, I've also written, and I guess I've also revised every year a set of \\nfairly detailed lecture notes that cover the technical content of this class. And so if you \\nvisit the course homepage, you'll also find the detailed lecture notes that go over in detail \\nall the math and equations and so on that I'll be doing in class.  \\nThere's also a newsgroup, su.class.cs229, also written on the handout. This is a \\nnewsgroup that's sort of a forum for people in the class to get to know each other and \\nhave whatever discussions you want to have amongst yourselves. So the class newsgroup \\nwill not be monitored by the TAs and me. But this is a place for you to form study groups \\nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored \\nby the TAs and me. So feel free to talk trash about this class there.  \\nIf you want to contact the teaching staff, please use the email address written down here, \\ncs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. This goes to an account that's read by all the TAs and me. So\")"

I'm curious, how many of you know \\nMATLAB? Wow, cool, quite a lot. Okay. So as part of the — act ually how many of you \\nknow Octave or have used Octave? Oh, okay, much smaller number.  \\nSo as part of this class, especially in the homeworks, we'll ask you to implement a few \\nprograms, a few machine learning algorithms as part of the homeworks. And most of those homeworks will be done in either MATLAB or in Octave, which is sort of — I \\nknow some people call it a free version of MATLAB, which it sort of is, sort of isn't.  \\nSo I guess for those of you that haven't seen MATLAB before, and I know most of you \\nhave, MATLAB is I guess part of the programming language that makes it very easy to \\nwrite codes using matrices, to write code for numerical routines, to move data around, to \\nplot data. And it's sort of an extremely easy to learn tool to use for implementing a lot of \\nlearning algorithms.  \\nAnd in case some of you want to work on your own home computer or something if you \\ndon't have a MATLAB license, for the purposes of this class, there's also — [inaudible] \\nwrite that down [inaudible] MATLAB — there' s also a software package called Octave \\nthat you can download for free off the Internet. And it has somewhat fewer features than \\nMATLAB, but it's free, and for the purposes of this class, it will work for just about \\neverything.\")"
